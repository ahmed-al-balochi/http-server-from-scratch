# HTTP Server in Golang

## Resources
I relied on [Beej's guide to Networking](https://www.beej.us/guide/bgnet/) to make this HTTP server in Go using Go's standard library.

## Things I learned
1. Sockets and connection handling.
2. How client and server communication works.
3. How headers work between server and client.
4. Logging using Golang's standard library.

## Why do this project?
I am taking Primeagen's advice where he said "go raw dog an HTTP server in GO, it's not that complicated."

Spoiler: yes, it's not complicated!

PS: Coded in VIM and TMUX btw on Debian
